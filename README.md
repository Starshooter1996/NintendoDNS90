Block Nintendo's Server on the Switch using your Pi-Hole creating a local DNS

Go to the settings on your Pi-Hole and navigate to "Blocklists"
Copy the raw file url into the URL bar for your blocklist and this will block Nintendo's servers on your switch.

Untick (on the blocklist screen) the url added to be able to access Nintendo's site when you want to

Enjoy the fast speeds of not using a far away DNS Server, as it will be hosted by you! Need help?
